Knapsack Problem Solver
Problem Description:
The task at hand is to solve the Knapsack Problem using two different optimization algorithms: Random Search and Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing.

The Knapsack Problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization where, given a set of items with weights and values, the objective is to determine the optimal combination of items to maximize the value while staying within a given weight limit. It is named after the scenario where a traveler must decide which items to carry in a knapsack of limited capacity.

Solution Approach:
Random Search: Initially, the problem will be tackled using a Random Search algorithm. This approach generates random solutions and evaluates their fitness, iterating until a satisfactory solution is found.

Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing (SAHC): Subsequently, the problem will be approached using the Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing algorithm. This technique iteratively improves upon the current solution by making small adjustments to the solution and selecting the one that results in the steepest increase in fitness.
